I think one of the hardest parts of computer programming is bringing your brain down to the level of a computer's. Computers are not intelligent; they are only able to execute our instructions at very high speeds. So when talking to them in their own language (programming) there's a loss of meaning in translation; like in human languages.

If you're unable to express your problems well to the computer or you don't have a good understanding of the problem in the first place, the computer will misunderstand and give you errors. They don't understand human languages, so they can't ask you what problem it is you want to solve.

It can be frustrating, to be sure, but once you've communicated your problem effectively and solved it, you'll find that the challenges you went through were worth it.

**P. S:** There are several AI-powered programs available today that seek to solve these problems, but they are not quite at the level we want them to be.
